## Our Mission and Goal

Our mission is to foster meaningful, hands-on learning experiences in STEM that span from elementary through high school. Through a growing collaboration between the Department of Computer and Information Science at Allegheny College and Crawford Central schools, we aim to build a strong foundation in computer science, engineering, and robotics that evolves as students grow.

This initiative provides students in elementary, middle, and high school with opportunities to engage in creative, inquiry-based STEM activities. By offering consistent, developmentally appropriate exposure to computing and robotics, we support students in building confidence, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills that will prepare them for the future.

We believe that every student—regardless of age, background, or experience—deserves access to high-quality STEM education and the opportunity to imagine themselves as future engineers, scientists, and creators.

## Why It Matters

STEM education is more than coding or circuits—it's about helping students understand the world around them, make informed decisions, and confidently explore solutions to real problems. These skills are relevant across all disciplines and vital for civic engagement, workforce development, and lifelong learning.

- **Elementary students** begin exploring basic logic, teamwork, and creative problem-solving.
- **Middle school students** expand into physical computing, data collection, and iterative design.
- **High school students** take on more complex projects, including robotics, control systems, and ethical use of technology.

By offering a continuous path through K–12, we support long-term engagement and academic growth in STEM fields.

## Pennsylvania Education Framework

### STEM in Pennsylvania

STEM education in Pennsylvania emphasizes access and literacy for all learners, with a focus on project-based learning, equity, reflection, iteration, and meaningful collaboration between schools, families, and community partners.

### Computer Science Literacy

While the current Pennsylvania framework emphasizes grades 7–12 for formal computer science pathways, we are working to bridge this gap by creating age-appropriate, standards-aligned learning experiences for students at all levels—from elementary logic puzzles to high school robotics systems.

These experiences are designed to meet and extend the state's educational goals by creating opportunities for early engagement, sustained exploration, and student-led discovery.
