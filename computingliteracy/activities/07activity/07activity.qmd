## Objectives

Children will identify, analyze, and create simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers.

## Materials Needed

- Paper and colored pencils/crayons
- Pattern blocks or cut-out shapes
- Optional: A whiteboard and markers

## Instructions

### Step 1: Introduction to Patterns

- Begin with a brief discussion about patterns, explaining that patterns are sequences that repeat in a certain order.
- Show examples of simple patterns using shapes and colors:
  - Shapes: `⬛⬛🔴⬛⬛🔴…` (Two squares, one circle, repeat)
  - Colors: 🔵🟢🔵🟢🔵… (Blue, green, repeat)
  - Numbers: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2… (Alternating 1 and 2)

### Step 2: Identify the Pattern

- Provide students with sets of simple sequences and ask them to identify the pattern. Examples:
  - Shapes: 🔺🔺⚫️🔺🔺⚫️…
  - Colors: 🟡🟡🟠🟡🟡🟠…
  - Numbers: 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6…

### Step 3: Extend the Pattern

- Once students identify the pattern, challenge them to continue the sequence by adding the next few elements.
  - Example: Sequence: 🔵🔵🟢🔵🔵🟢… (They add 🔵🔵🟢 next)

### Step 4: Create Your Own Pattern

- Instruct students to create their own simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers on paper.
- Encourage them to share their patterns with a partner and see if their partner can identify and extend the pattern.

### Step 5: Pattern Puzzles

- Create "pattern puzzles" where some elements in the sequence are missing, and ask students to fill in the blanks.
  - Example: Sequence: 🟣, 🟣, 🟤, ___, 🟣, 🟣, 🟤, ___ (They fill in with 🟣, 🟣, 🟤)

### Extensions

- For students who complete the exercises, introduce them to the coding challenge on [Blockly Turtle](https://blockly.games/turtle?lang=en). This program prompts students to code shapes.

## Reflection

- Have students display their patterns and share them with the class to foster pride in their work and appreciation for the diversity of patterns created.
- After completing the Blockly Turtle challenge, discuss with students the challenges they faced and how they solved coding problems.

## Learning Outcomes

- Students will develop the ability to recognize and extend patterns.
- Students will enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Students will learn to create their own patterns and communicate them effectively.
