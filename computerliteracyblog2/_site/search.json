Place a barricade on one of the roads, explaining that the primary route is blocked due to construction.\nIllustrate how and why the car needs to decide to take an alternative route if the primary route is blocked.\nBlock another route, and ask students what they would do now since two main routes are blocked.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Interactive Time\n\nAsk students what they would do if they were in this situation. Would they take the other route? How would they do it? Are there any other options they would prefer?\nDivide the class into two groups, each group with a laptop under supervision.\nUsing block code, guide each group to set up their robot (which will serve as the car) to reenact the two situations.\nAllow the students to test their code by running the robot on the road setup."

Insert it in the correct position (before or after the first strip).\nTake the third strip and compare it to the already sorted strips, inserting it in the correct position.\nRepeat the process until all strips are sorted.\n\nReference video to be played before activity: Insertion Sort Algorithm"

This could be forward, back, stop, dance etc.\nRemove only a maximum of two mats at a time. Do not remove mats that will not allow them to be able to move effectively at all -Example: Removing the forward and back mat at the same time"

For example, they could create a rule that the Bee Bot cannot move backwards.\nOn a separate sheet of paper, have students write down the rules they have created, specifying what their opponents are not allowed to do.\n\n\n\nStep 3: Completing Routes\n\nOnce students have created their routes and conditions, have them swap with their partners.\nTime the students to see who can create a route first, conducting multiple rounds with different partners.\nEnsure that only group members collaborate, with no assistance from opposing teams.\nIf a student is struggling, provide guidance on the initial steps to help them succeed."

Examples:\n\nShapes: 🔺🔺⚫️🔺🔺⚫️…\nColors: 🟡🟡🟠🟡🟡🟠…\nNumbers: 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6…\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Extend the Pattern\n\nOnce students identify the pattern, challenge them to continue the sequence by adding the next few elements.\n\nExample: Sequence: 🔵🔵🟢🔵🔵🟢… (They add 🔵🔵🟢 next)\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Create Your Own Pattern\n\nInstruct students to create their own simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers on paper.\nEncourage them to share their patterns with a partner and see if their partner can identify and extend the pattern.\n\n\n\nStep 5: Pattern Puzzles\n\nCreate “pattern puzzles” where some elements in the sequence are missing, and ask students to fill in the blanks.\n\nExample: Sequence: 🟣, 🟣, 🟤, , 🟣, 🟣, 🟤,  (They fill in with 🟣, 🟣, 🟤)\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\n\nFor students who complete the exercises, introduce them to the coding challenge on Blockly Turtle.
